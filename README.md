## Getting Started
**Prerequisites**

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.12 or higher

Node.js (v18 or higher) 

npm or yarn â€“ Package manager

Git â€“ Version control

MongoDB â€“ Database (local or Atlas)

Twilio Account â€“ For SMS alert integration

**Installation**
1. Clone the Repository
   git clone https://github.com/Abhishek8915/EcoGov.git
   cd EcoGov

2. Install Dependencies
   Backend (FastAPI) dependencies:
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt

Frontend (React) dependencies:

cd ../frontend
npm install

Note: If using any ML models or PyTorch, ensure CUDA or CPU dependencies are installed as needed.

3. Environment Setup

Backend Environment (backend/.env):

PORT=8000

##  Models Implemented
### 1.  Flood Detection (Deep Learning)
- **Input:** Satellite imagery / camera feed.  
- **Output:** Flood masks, estimated flood level.  
- **Impact:** Enables remote monitoring and faster response.  

### 2.  Mangrove Density Classifier
- **Features (7 total):** Latitude, Longitude, Elevation, Proximity to coast, NDVI, Rainfall, Slope.  
- **Output:** Binary classification â†’ `Mangrove: Yes / No`.  
- **Impact:** Monitors habitat cover & prevents ecosystem degradation.  

---

##  User Workflows
### For Authorities
- Hazard map dashboards with historical analytics.
- Incident tracking & disaster response management.  

### For Communities
- **Multilingual SMS / notification alerts**.  
- **Offline peer-to-peer alert sharing** during poor connectivity.  
- Community reporting (photos, audio notes).  

---

##  Impact & Value Proposition
-  **30â€“60 minutes earlier alerts** than baseline.  
-  **>80% accuracy** in anomaly detection.  
-  **20% faster coordination** in disaster scenarios.  
-  Safeguards **blue carbon ecosystems**, aiding climate goals.  
-  Promotes **govt. & NGO R&D adoption** via data insights.  

---

##  Challenges & Mitigation
- **Data quality gaps** â†’ use of multi-source redundancy.  
- **Low community participation** â†’ gamification + local languages.  
- **Real-time scaling issues** â†’ cloud-native, serverless architecture.  

---

##  Future Roadmap
- Govt. integration with national disaster platforms.  
- Tracking **mangrove afforestation & density recovery efforts**.  
- **SAR-based deep learning** with Sentinel-1 data.  
- Offline-first **mobile app** for alerts & feedback.  
- Fisherfolk wearable IoT devices for **cyclone & theft alerts**.
