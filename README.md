## Overview
EcoGov is a full-stack coastal flood alert platform that enables end-to-end management of flood monitoring and emergency response. It empowers NGOs, local authorities, and coastal communities to seamlessly participate in a secure, real-time, and automated ecosystem. By combining machine learning-based flood predictions, location-specific risk assessments, and instant SMS alerts, EcoGov ensures timely action and enhances community resilience against coastal floods.

**Timely detection and role-based alerts can save lives, property, and ecosystems.**

---

##  Our Solution
A comprehensive **AI/ML-powered early warning and monitoring platform** that:  
- Integrates **multi-source data** (satellites, sensors, historical records).  
- Uses **Deep Learning** for real-time flood detection.  
- Predicts **mangrove density loss** from geospatial data.  
- Provides **role-based, multilingual alerts** (SMS, Push notifications, P2P offline sharing).  
- Engages **communities via crowdsourced reporting + gamification**.  
- Offers **dashboards & hazard maps** for authorities.

##  Impact
Environmental: Enhances disaster preparedness and mitigates the environmental impact of coastal floods by enabling timely interventions.

Economic: Reduces potential economic losses for coastal communities and local businesses by providing early warnings and actionable flood data.

Social: Strengthens community resilience and safety by enabling NGOs, authorities, and residents to respond quickly to flood threats, fostering trust and collaboration.

##  Key Innovations (USP)
✅ **Deep Learning Flood Detection** – Real-time flood level estimation with masked imagery.  
✅ **Mangrove Density Prediction** – Predicts presence/absence of mangroves using 7 features (lat, long, elevation, climate data, etc.).  
✅ **Multi-Source Data Fusion** – Satellites + sensors + API-based weather/tide info.  
✅ **Explainable AI Alerts** – Each alert comes with drivers & confidence levels.  
✅ **Peer-to-Peer Alerts** – Works even in low/no internet zones.  
✅ **Community Participation** – Reporting module with crowdsourced validation & gamification.  
✅ **Blue Carbon Ecosystem Protection** – Dedicated monitoring module for mangroves, salt marshes & seagrass.

##  Models Implemented
### 1.  Flood Detection (Deep Learning)
- **Input:** Satellite imagery / camera feed.  
- **Output:** Flood masks, estimated flood level.  
- **Impact:** Enables remote monitoring and faster response.  

### 2.  Mangrove Density Classifier
- **Features (7 total):** Latitude, Longitude, Elevation, Proximity to coast, NDVI, Rainfall, Slope.  
- **Output:** Binary classification → `Mangrove: Yes / No`.  
- **Impact:** Monitors habitat cover & prevents ecosystem degradation.  

---

##  User Workflows
### For Authorities
- Hazard map dashboards with historical analytics.
- Incident tracking & disaster response management.  

### For Communities
- **Multilingual SMS / notification alerts**.  
- **Offline peer-to-peer alert sharing** during poor connectivity.  
- Community reporting (photos, audio notes).  

---

##  Impact & Value Proposition
-  **30–60 minutes earlier alerts** than baseline.  
-  **>80% accuracy** in anomaly detection.  
-  **20% faster coordination** in disaster scenarios.  
-  Safeguards **blue carbon ecosystems**, aiding climate goals.  
-  Promotes **govt. & NGO R&D adoption** via data insights.  

---

##  Challenges & Mitigation
- **Data quality gaps** → use of multi-source redundancy.  
- **Low community participation** → gamification + local languages.  
- **Real-time scaling issues** → cloud-native, serverless architecture.  

---

##  Future Roadmap
- Govt. integration with national disaster platforms.  
- Tracking **mangrove afforestation & density recovery efforts**.  
- **SAR-based deep learning** with Sentinel-1 data.  
- Offline-first **mobile app** for alerts & feedback.  
- Fisherfolk wearable IoT devices for **cyclone & theft alerts**.
